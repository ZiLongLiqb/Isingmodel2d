# Isingmodel MC
THIS IS A PROGRAM FOR FERROMAGNETIC ISING MODEL. I SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH TWO DIFFERENT METHODS. ONE IS THE TRADITIONAL MENTE CARLO, 
ANOTHER IS CLUSTER METHOD. BY NOW, THE DETAIL OF ALL THESE TWO PROGRAMS ARE COMMITED. LATER, I WILL WRITE A SUMMARY TO COMPARE THE TWO
DIFFERENT MATHODS. YOU MAY SEE THAT, WHEN NEAR THE PHASE POINT, CLUSTER MATHOD PERFORMS BETTER. BUT THE SHORTCOMING OF CLUSTER METHOD IS 
ALSO APPARENT, IT PERFOMS WELL WHEN THE MODEL IS FERROMAGNETIC ISING MODEL OR IT PERFOMS WORSE THAN TRADITIONAL MC METHOD.
